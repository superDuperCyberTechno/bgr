## Fub
*v1.0.0*

A simple card shedding game with bluffing. Every turn sees an increase in rank until someone decides that enough is enough and checks the cards, restarting the round.
 Originally concieved as house rules for <i>Cheat</i>/<i>Bullshit</i>/<i>I Doubt It</i>, it evolved into its own thing. Notably, it has a less pronounced snowball-effect, and the winning condition forces additional considerations. In addition, it gives users more agency as it allows them to discard a variable number of cards.
### Requirements
2-9 players. A standard deck of 52 cards (including jokers).
### Goal
Be the first to get rid of all your cards.
### How to Play
Deal each player 5 cards. Put the rest of the deck aside - face down - to form the stock.

In a clockwise fashion, every participant plays any number of cards face down and announces a single rank. This rank must be at least as high as the last one, unless this is the start of a new round - in which case, <i>any</i> rank is legal. If all cards in your hand are of identical rank and you can legally play them (higher rank than last announced rank), play them face up and win the game. This ends the game instantly.

After a rank has been announced, <i>any</i> player can challenge it. When doing so, reveal the played cards... If the card(s) <b>did</b> match the announced rank, the challenger draws as many card(s) as was just played. The last player then starts a new round with an empty play pile. If the announced rank <b>did not</b> match <b>all</b> the card ranks, the last player draws <b>double</b> the amount of cards played. The challenger then starts a new round with an empty play pile.
### Notes
- On a player's turn, if they only have one card left and it isn't ranked high enough to close the game, they draw another card and pass their turn.
- Jokers always have the same rank as the card right below it, in the play pile, when played. Otherwise its rank is 0.
- If no player challenges the play, the next player simply start from step 1.
- The number of cards played have no effect on the amount of cards that can be played afterwards. It is allowed to play any amount of cards as long as the announced rank is at least as high as the last one.
- When restarting a round, shuffle the discard pile back into the stock.
