## Stiko
*v0.9.0*

Trick-taking game with an inverse trump mechanic that quickly changes the playing field. Modified version of the commercial game *Stick 'Em* (AKA. *Sticheln*).
### Requirements
3-8 players. A standard deck of 52 cards. If you include jokers, never include more than 1 less the total amount of players, i.e.: a 3 player game should include no more than 2 jokers.
### Goal
Earn most points (avoid negative points).
### How to Play
Deal each player 6 cards. Put the rest of the deck aside - face down - to form the stock. Each player plays one card face up, its suit dictates the player's bad suit.

In a clockwise fashion, each player plays one card from their hand. Depending on the card played, a winner is determined...
* If *all* cards *did* follow the lead suit, the first played, highest card wins the trick.
* If *any* card did *not* follow the lead suit, the highest card *not* in the lead suit wins the trick.
The winner of the trick, leads the next.

When all tricks have been played, tally up points: All bad-suited cards each yield -1 point, all other cards yield 1 point.
### Notes
* Cards are ranked A-K (lowest to highest), but Aces beat all face cards. Aces that beat face cards can be beaten by any numbered card.
* Jokers always lose and are suitless. Cannot by played as a bad suit.
