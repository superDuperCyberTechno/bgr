The *BGR* is a collection of tabletop game rules, all playable with standard tabletop supplies; a deck of cards, six-sided dice, various tokens or any combination of them all. The games strive to adhere to the simplest possible ruleset while providing meaningful gameplay with both luck and skill in hopefully equal measures. All of this presented in a gloriously boring, fast-loading, well-behaved website.

Some games provide completely new experiences, while others refine well-established classics for an overall better experience.  A few will be the un-edited classics themselves, because some games are great as they are.

There are some things that tie them all together though...
1. No game will ever be dependent on anything other than any combination of the following supplies...
	1.  A standard 52-card deck. More than one deck may be required.
	2.  Six-sided dice.
	3. Tokens of any kind. These could include chips, meeples, cubes, matches or any other pile of thingies to keep track of resources.
	4. Pen and paper.
2. Rules should always be as simple as possible while providing as much agency as required to make the game entertaining. This rule is highly malleable and achievable only by testing.
3. AI-generated content of any kind is not allowed. We expect people to actually play the games and write their own words.

*BGR* is intended to be the definitive source of included rules and will change over time as collaborators provide well-tested feedback. In other words, the ultimate goal is to provide the best possible rules for all games within. To that end, **everyone** is encouraged to participate, both with changes to current rules but also with completely new games.
