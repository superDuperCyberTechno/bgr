# Better Games Repository
<small>*A slightly pissed-off, highly opinionated collection of good tabletop games, playable by the majority of the human race, curated by a bunch of pedantic nerds, you are welcome.*</small>

---

The *BGR* is a collection of tabletop game rules, all playable with standard tabletop supplies; a deck of cards, six-sided dice, various tokens or any combination of them all. The games strive to adhere to the simplest possible ruleset while providing meaningful gameplay with both luck and skill in hopefully equal measures. All of this presented in a gloriously boring, fast-loading, well-behaved website.

Some games provide completely new experiences, while others refine well-established classics for an overall better experience.  A few will be the un-edited classics themselves, because some games are great as they are.

There are some things that tie them all together though...
1. No game will ever be dependent on anything other than any combination of the following supplies...
	1.  A standard 52-card deck. More than one deck may be required.
	2.  Six-sided dice.
	3. Tokens of any kind. These could include chips, meeples, cubes, matches or any other pile of thingies to keep track of resources.
	4. Pen and paper.
2. Rules should always be as simple as possible while providing as much agency as required to make the game entertaining. This rule is highly malleable and achievable only by testing.
3. AI-generated content of any kind is not allowed. We expect people to actually play the games and write their own words.

*BGR* is intended to be the definitive source of included rules and will change over time as collaborators provide well-tested feedback. In other words, the ultimate goal is to provide the best possible rules for all games within. To that end, **everyone** is encouraged to participate, both with changes to current rules but also with completely new games.

## What are *bad* rules?
There are hundreds (if not thousands) of games available for a standard 52-card deck. However, this only a half-truth: Most games are simply variants of other, older games. In fact, many related card games are so similar, that one could argue they are the same game. Another important thing to note is that newer variants are rarely any better than their progenitors...

For some reason, probably not apparent to anyone but the most celebrated anthropologists, many of the well-established rules that live within these games survive the test of time, regardless of how much sense they make. Thus, many ideas found within card games are the half-assed remnants of frankly *awful* game design...

**Luck exclusivity** encompasses all games that only ever really depend on luck. This can sometimes be obscured by overly complicated rules. In short, these games can be boiled down to simply flipping a coin. - In other words, they are a waste of time.
A classic example is *War* which many agree is simply a way to kill time or introducde kids to card games. This game is essentially just a very long series of coin flips that (sometimes) end with a winner.
Thus, luck as a sole base is a no go. However, luck combined with others core elements is pretty much always a good idea.

**Arbitrary rankings** is something that can be found in many games and can in some cases be the only difference between 2 wholly independent games. Many people don't seem to be bothered by this and will gladly accept the fact that 4 of Hearts is now the best ranked card in the game. More often than not, there is no rhyme or reason to this rule and it only yields one single thing: Overhead. It makes it harder to actually understand, - and eventually play the game.

**Following suit** is one the most widely spread conventions in card games. The sheer amount of games that use this mechanic is staggering and it is the bedrock of pretty much every trick-taker in existence. The premise is fairly simple: Whoever plays the first card in a round determines what suit any following card must have. But, since there is no guarantee anyone *can* fulfill this requirement, players are allowed to play other cards if they can't follow. The good thing is that this makes it possible to deduce valuable information about the other player's cards as you are not allowed to look at these directly.
The adverse result is a game where cheating is not only extremely easy, but also very powerful. It also makes it prone to errors. Players shouldn't be able to do anything that breaks the game - intentional or not - without other players noticing right away. Ensuring this eliminates cheating but also makes the learning process faster. 
The solution is obvious: Remove the requirement to follow suit or integrate dishonesty as a valid strategy.
Most people will quickly retort, saying that if you play with cheaters, maybe play with other people but this is a roundabout way of looking at the problem... Ultimately, most games aren't about trust, they're about deceit and we should embrace this. So, instead of trying to enforce integrity on your players, let them stab each other in the back. Embrace this dynamic and not only make the game simpler, but also more fun.

**Convoluted scoring** is a broad term, it usually boils down to scoring that are either really hard to remember or happens so often that you need to constantly keep tally and do math. Or even worse: Both. Often, it will glue you to the notepad half the time as you try to keep up with the actual game.
A lot of games have zero qualms about issuing asinine point scores to wildly different scenarios that are mostly impossible to deduce. Here, nothing will help you other than rawdogging the rules and simply remembering how points are handed out. Or reference sheets.
A subset of these offenders also arbitrarily multiply all scores so that someone might never score less than 10 points. A better combo might yield 15 points. It doesn't take a mathematical genius to simply reduce the numbers by their lowest denominator and realize that above is practically identical to 2 and 3 points.
Scoring should be almost instantly comprehendable, easily calculated and only rarely depend on a notepad.
