# Better Games Repository
The *BGR* is a collection of tabletop game rules, all playable with standard tabletop supplies; a deck of cards, six-sided dice, various tokens or any combination of them all. The games strive to adhere to the simplest possible ruleset while providing meaningful gameplay with both luck and skill in hopefully equal measures.

Some games provide completely new experiences, while others refine well-established classics for an overall better experience.

There are some things that tie them all together though...
1. No game will ever be dependent on anything other than any combination of the following supplies...
	1.  A standard 52-card deck. More than one deck may be required.
	2.  Six-sided dice.
	3. Tokens of any kind. These could include chips, meeples, cubes, matches or any other pile of thingies to keep track of resources.
	4. Pen and paper.
2. Rules should always be as simple as possible while providing as much agency as required to make the game entertaining. This rule is highly malleable and achievable only by testing.
3. AI-generated content of any kind is not allowed. We expect people to actually play the games and write their own words.

*BGR* is intended to be the definitive source of included rules and will change over time as collaborators provide well-tested feedback. In other words, the ultimate goal is to provide the best possible rules for all games within. To that end, **everyone** is encouraged to participate, both with changes to current rules but also with completely new games.

## What are *good* rules?
There are hundreds (if not thousands) of games available for a standard 52-card deck. However, this only a half-truth: Most games are simply variants of other, older games. In fact, many related card games are so similar, that one could argue they are the same game. Another important thing to note is that newer variants are rarely any better than their progenitors...
For some reason, probably not apparent to anyone but the most celebrated anthropologists, many of the well-established rules that live within these games survive the test of time, regardless of how much sense they make. Thus, many conventions found within card games are remnants of frankly *awful* game design...

**Following suit**, one the most widely spread conventions in card games. The sheer amount of games that use this mechanic is staggering and it is the base of pretty much every trick-taker in existence. The premise is fairly simple: Whoever plays the first card in a round determines what suit any following card must have. But, since there is no guarantee anyone *can* follow suit, players are allowed to play another card if they do *not* have a card of the leading suit. This makes it possible to deduce valuable information about the other player's cards as you are not allowed to look at them directly.
The adverse result is a game where cheating is not only extremely easy, but also very powerful. The solution is obvious: Remove the requirement to follow suit or integrate the cheating as a valid strategy. 
Most people will quickly retort, saying that if you play with cheaters, maybe play with other people. This is a roundabout way of looking at the problem... Ultimately, most games aren't about trust, they're about deceit and their should embrace this. So, instead of trying to enforce integrity on your players, let them stab each other in the back.
